        <p>I am a recent mathematics grad with good technical skills including familiarity with scripting in an academic and personal setting and with SQL. I am a high level thinker able to organize and manage multiple complex processes simultaneously. I excel at communication, abstract reasoning, and research. In particular, I excel at abstract analysis of complex systems, identifying such systems in real world data and predicting how they are likely to evolve.</p>
